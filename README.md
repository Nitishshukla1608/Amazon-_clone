ðŸš€  Built an Amazon Homepage Clone! ðŸ”¥
 Excited to share my latest project â€“ an Amazon Homepage Clone built using HTML & CSS! . This project replicates the look and feel of Amazonâ€™s homepage with fully functional UI elements, including:
 âœ… Hero Section â€“ Captivating banner just like the original .
 âœ… Search Bar â€“ Smooth and responsive for a seamless experience .
 âœ… Option Bar â€“ Easy navigation for users .
 âœ… Cart Option â€“ Shopping cart icon with interactive design ðŸ›’
 âœ… Product Cards â€“ Displaying items beautifully in a grid view .
 
 This project helped me dive deeper into responsive design and UI structuring. Looking forward to adding more functionalities soon! ðŸš€
